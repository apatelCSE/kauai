<h2 tabindex="0">About the Island</h2>

<p><i>Kaua'i, Americanized as Kauai, is geologically the oldest of the main Hawaiian Islands. With an area of 562.3 square miles 
  (1,456.4 km<sup>2</sup>), it is the fourth-largest of these islands and the 21st largest island in the United States. Known also 
  as the "Garden Isle", Kaua'i lies 105 miles (169 km) across the Kaua'i Channel, northwest of O'ahu. This island is the site of 
  Waimea Canyon State Park.</i></p>

<p>During the reign of King Kamehameha, the islands of Kaua'i and Ni'ihau were the last Hawaiian Islands to join his Kingdom of 
  Hawai'i. Their ruler, Kaumuali'i, resisted Kamehameha for years. King Kamehameha twice prepared a huge armada of ships and canoes
  to take the islands by force, and twice failed; once due to a storm, and once due to an epidemic. In the face of the threat of a
  further invasion, however, Kaumuali'i decided to join the kingdom without bloodshed, and became Kamehameha's vassal in 1810. He 
  ceded the island to the Kingdom of Hawai'i upon his death in 1824.</p>

<p>Kaua'i's origins are volcanic, the island having been formed by the passage of the Pacific Plate over the Hawaii hotspot. At 
  approximately five million years old, it is the oldest of the main islands.[12] The highest peak on this mountainous island is 
  Kawaikini at 5,243 feet (1,598 m). The second highest peak is Mount Wai'ale'ale near the center of the island, 5,148 ft (1,569 m) 
  above sea level. One of the wettest spots on earth, with an annual average rainfall of 460 inches (38.3 ft; 11.7 m), is located 
  on the east side of Mount Wai'ale'ale. The high annual rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountains, carving out 
  canyons with many scenic waterfalls. On the west side of the island, Waimea town is located at the mouth of the Waimea River, 
  whose flow formed Waimea Canyon, one of the world's most scenic canyons, which is part of Waimea Canyon State Park. At three 
  thousand feet (910 m) deep, Waimea Canyon is often referred to as "The Grand Canyon of the Pacific". Kokeo Point lies on the 
  south side of the island. The Na Pali Coast is a center for recreation in a wild setting, including kayaking past the beaches, 
  or hiking on the trail along the coastal cliffs.[14] The headland, Kuahonu Point, is on the south-east of the island.</p>

<h2 tabindex="0"> The Best Time to Visit Kauai </h2>

<h3> Ideal Months to Go </h3>
<ul>
  <li> September to November </li>
  <li> April to June </li>
</ul>
<p>What makes these months ideal:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The weather is better. Less rain! </li>
  <li> Airfare and hotel rates drop. </li>
</ol>

  <p>Kaua'i's climate is tropical, with generally humid and stable conditions year round, although weather phenomena and infrequent 
    storms have caused instances of extreme weather. At the lower elevations the annual precipitation varies from an average of 
    about 50 inches on the windward (northeastern) shore, to less than 20 inches on the (southwestern) leeward side of the island.
    Average temperature in Lihu'e, the county seat, ranges from 78 <span>&#8457;</span> (26 <span>&#8451;</span>) in February to 85 
    <span>&#8457;</span> (29 <span>&#8451;</span>) in August and September. Kaua'i's mountainous regions offer cooler temperatures 
    and provide a pleasant contrast to the warm coastal areas. At the K<span>&#333;</span>ke'e state park, 3,200-4,200 ft (980-1,280 m)
    ASL, day temperatures vary from an average of 45 <span>&#8457;</span> (7 <span>&#8451;</span>) in January to 68 
    <span>&#8457;</span> (20 <span>&#8451;</span>) in July. In the winter temperatures have been known to drop down to the 30s and 
    40s at K<span>&#333;</span>ke'e state park, which holds an unofficial record low of 29 <span>&#8457;</span> 
    −2 <span>&#8451;</span>) recorded in February 1986 at Kanaloahuluhulu Meadow.</p>
  
  <p>Precipitation in Kaua'i's mountainous regions averages 50–100 in (1,300-2,500 mm) annually. Situated about ten miles (16 km) 
    southeast of K<span>&#333;</span>ke'e state park at an elevation of 5,075 ft (1,547 m), is the Mt. Wai'ale'ale rain gauge.[15]
    Mt. Wai'ale'ale is often cited in literature as being the wettest spot on earth, although this has been disputed. Based on 
    data for the period from 1931 through 1960 the average yearly precipitation was 460 in (11,700 mm) (U.S. Environmental Science 
    Services Administration, 1968). Between 1949 and 2004 the average yearly precipitation at Mt. Wai'ale'ale was 374 in (9,500 mm).</p>
  
  <p>Not only does Kaua'i hold a record in average yearly precipitation, it also holds a record in hourly precipitation. During a 
    storm on January 24-25, 1956, a rain gauge at Kaua'i's former Kilauea Sugar Plantation recorded a record twelve inches (305 mm)
    of precipitation in just 60 minutes. The value for one hour is an underestimate, since the rain gauge overflowed, which may 
    have resulted in an error by as much as an inch.[17] An accurate measurement may have exceeded Holt, Missouri's world record 
    rainfall of 12 inches in 42 minutes on June 22, 1947.</p>

<!-- some notes on viewports in case i ever need it:
vw: 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
vh: 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
vmin: 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height vs. width).
vmax: 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height vs. width).
to use it: say height: vh; or width: vw; etc -->
